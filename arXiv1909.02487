I think your citation to [53] should have actually been to [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00422). I think this occurred because when looking at [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01005), you copied down their reference 27 instead of 28! 
 - No comparison to energy differences or experiments for anything beyond atoms and diatomics.
 - H-10 results are worse than MRCI and AFQMC results.
